Group worked on design document over weekend; submitted for review. Started basic project start (django files, requirements_env, etc).

LoganF -- 2024-05-28 23:06
Made the models from the design doc into django. Implemented an initial data view, and a view that inserts a pokemon card from their card ID into the respective model database by calling the API.

Configured vue with django. Vue now connects with a search view. Need to work on passing API data/search query results into Vue.

Created home page and navbar. Got started on detail view, but had little success.

LoganF -- 2024-05-31 22:49
Got search data from api in an accessible array in Vue. Need to work on displaying search results in a reactive table (ie filtered by rarity, price, etc)

Updated pokemon list view, looks a lot better and now extends base

LoganF -- 2024-06-03 18:00
Worked on displaying search results, and added an option to filter by rarity. Buttons also add the proper card. Need to work on the CSS to make it look nice.

Worked on detailbis, fixed many errors, tried to get data onto vue

MarcusN -- 2024-06-03 20:56
Completed detail bis, now displays name and card. Added clickable cards onto pokemon_list that send you to detail view.

LoganF -- 2024-06-10 13:44
Finished the css for displaying search results, fixed error in detail view. Need to work on view that takes user input and redirects to search results url.
