Group worked on design document over weekend; submitted for review. Started basic project start (django files, requirements_env, etc).

Made the models from the design doc into django. Implemented an initial data view, and a view that inserts a pokemon card from their card ID into the respective model database by calling the API.

Configured vue with django. Vue now connects with a search view. Need to work on passing API data/search query results into Vue.
